 Eskom’s sudden spell of concern stems from four separate incidents that occurred between May and June. The incidents involved delivery vehicles which came into contact with electricity after snagging electricity lines while offloading their freight at shop outlets.  An investigation following these incidents has led Eskom to two critical factors contributing to the cause of the accidents: Lack of supervision and negligence by the driver and assistants. Eskom would like to alert trucking/transportation agencies of the safety risk involved during the loading or offloading process in the vicinity of power lines and electrical installations. Trucks are made from steel and metal which easily conducts electricity. Any contact with electricity poses a risk and may result in serious injury or death.

Eskom would therefore like fellow South Africans, especially those in the trucking business to note the following life-saving tips: •Never park any vehicles, including trucks, delivery vehicles or forklifts under power lines.
•Never operate cranes or cherry-pickers under power lines.
•Never offload any goods, including building material or beverages, under or near power lines.
•Never carry steel rods or pipes under power-lines. If there is no other way, make sure that the pipe or rod lies horizontally as far away from the power-line as possible.
•Never build a house or plant trees under power lines.
•Teach children not to throw objects (chains, slings, shoes, kites, toys, etc.) onto power-lines.
•Teach children not to play near any transformers or to climb any electrical structure.
•Treat all electrical cables as live and never touch it.
•Report any vandalism of Eskom property, illegal connections and electricity theft to Eskom or to the police.
