 With over 15 000 participants taking part in this premier community event in Mpumalanga, said Chantal Bekker (GTR 2018 Chair)
The race will be run from Middelburg to eMalahleni this year with the end point at the Witbank Dam. Masson Music will entertain the crowds from early until Martin Bester from the Jacaranda FM Morning show takes over at around 13h00 with his “vir die liefde toer”.
A dedicated Children’s play area will keep the kids entertained all day and food stalls will ensure that the tummies stay full. Also read: The race is on! We would like to advise the community that the R555 between Middelburg and eMalahleni will be closed to traffic from 6:00am on Saturday the 18th of August up until 13h00 to ensure the safety of participants.
The road will re-open in a moving road closure as the runners progress. The roads affected by the partial road closure during the event are OR Tambo up to Mandela street, Mona street, Bethal Street, Mandela Road up to Witbank Dam. Road users should expect delays and your patience is requested. Although these streets are not completely closed, we do advise the public to rather avoid these areas between 6am and 1pm on Saturday the 18th of August, said Bekker. TRAC has once more committed to giving concession vouchers to Class 1 vehicles only at R23.00. These vouchers will be handed out at the various closure points near the R555 whilst the road closure is in progress.
