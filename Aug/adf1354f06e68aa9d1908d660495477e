 The crèche is run from a church in Newtown, with no funding from the government.
They solely rely on school fees from parents. Thandi Mdhluli said that sometimes parents do not make payments which makes it difficult for them to operate. “All we want is to see children being educated and being in a safe place during the day”. She also runs a school-fee-free crèche for children whose parents can’t afford to pay fees. The Entokozweni Daycare is under financial constraints hence it was identified by various companies during Mandela Day to donate much-needed items.
Mayivuthe Contractors donated mattresses, new doors, tables and food to the daycare centre. Ms Mdhluli said they can not install the new doors because it is expensive and the structure of the building is not stable.
“We are pleading with residents to help us acquire land to build a crèche and we would appreciate any food donations. Any kind of donation is welcomed,” she added.
