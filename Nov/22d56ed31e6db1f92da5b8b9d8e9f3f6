 According to information the boys were discovered foaming at the mouths in a semi-unconscious state next to Koets Street. No one is sure what caused the children’s condition. It was rumoured that they went off by themselves “to smoke something”, a source told www.mobserver.co.za. Only one of the boys’ age was known. An ambulance was seen taking the children to the Middelburg Provincial Hospital for treatment and a police vehicle was also spotted at the scene. Speculations under readers have surfaced that it might be the new synthetic drug know as Blaze or Herbal Blend. Though their symptoms were similar to that of the learners treated in Pretoria, this cannot be confirmed.
