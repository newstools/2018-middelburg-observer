 On Sunday, the 7th of October, Goodwill Mongane (32) was one of two pedestrians killed on the N4. Reports were received that Mr Mongane was killed in a hit and run and his death was only reported after a second motorist drove over his body. Palesa and her husband are from Welkom in the Freestate. At the time of the accident, Palesa and her eight year old son were in Nelspruit. Mr Mongane was on his way to fetch them from Nelspruit and was hitch-hiking along the N4. Palesa told the Middelburg Observer that she reported her husband as missing. The detective handling his case contacted her and informed her that they traced the last activity of his phone to a farm in the Middelburg area. She then came from Nelspruit to Middelburg and asked the police whether there were any unidentified bodies in the morgue. After a month, her search ended at the state mortuary where she identified one of the bodies as her husband’s. “I just wish I could find the person who is responsible,” Palesa said in grief. Goodwill Mongane leaves behind his wife Palesa, his eight year old son, his father, step-mother and brothers and sisters. •New information has come to light regarding the death of Mr Goodwill Mongane, read Friday’s newspaper for the full story.
