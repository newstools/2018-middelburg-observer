 The Hendrina road has been closed by protesters repeatedly throughout the week, leaving motorists stuck in long queues for hours. Strike action at Optimum Mine has resulted in the blockage of the N11 continuously throughout the year, but protests sparked up again since Monday. The reason for the demonstrations stems from the eight Gupta-owned companies that were placed under business rescue some time ago.
Contract workers from these companies have been without salaries for months on end, with no sign of when they will be paid.

Klopper told www.mobserver.co.za that negotiations need to be settled with the liquidator, Mr Chevon Cooper, who is based in Bloemfontein.
They have received no information from Cooper as to when an effort will be made to meet with the protesters, leaving the ball in the air. He explained that he can understand their frustrations but that there is little he can do. Klopper says that despite the protests, things are rather peaceful. Up until now, there has been no injury or damage to property and the strike action mainly takes place outside the property of Optimum Mine.
