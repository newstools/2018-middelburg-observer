 The toddler’s drowning accident caused a stir among residents and thousands of rands were raised to foot his medical bill. Brendon Bouwer fell into a swimming pool on Sunday the 18th of November. He was resuscitated by one of their neighbours who happened to be a nurse at life Midmed Hospital, Sister Veronica Visagie.
According to Sister Visagie’s account, Brendon was without a pulse or heartbeat when she arrived at the scene. Also read: Two-year-old boy still hospitalised after near drowning After administering CPR, she turned to her husband and informed him that Brendon “was dead”. Her husband encouraged her to carry on with CPR and finally, Brendon began to breathe again. The family rushed Brendon to Life Midmed Hospital where he was stabilised but he had to be transferred to Witbank Provincial Hospital because the family does not have medical aid. He was kept under sedation in the Intensive Care Unit and was awaiting a CT scan to assess the amount of damage done to the brain. Zandalee Bouwer told www.mobserver.co.za that Brendon was fighting the sedation and soon after that, the toddler awoke and was happy to see his parents.
He has since been discharged and is recovering at home. To read more about Brendon’s recovery, see Tuesday’s issue of the Middelburg Observer.
