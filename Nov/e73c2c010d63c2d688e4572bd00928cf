 Richard Lekotswane Nkwanyana (48) and Peter Mathekanyana Molapo (58) were found guilty of submitting false subsistence and travel claims in 2006. The pair were booked into a guest house for two days but only stayed for one. They then manipulated the information on the invoice and on the computer system, claiming R850 per person. Advocate Patrick Nkuna for the state, managed to prove that the invoices were forged. Advocate Nkuna told the court that it should be seen as an aggravating factor that the fraud was committed by a person of stature in a position of responsibility.
