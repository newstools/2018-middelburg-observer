 Police have handed over the footage in hope that members of the public might help identify the robbers. TotalSports was robbed around 09:30 on the 24th of October. The staff were held at gunpoint and asked to empty out the cash registers and safe. Sport shoes and other products were also taken. The man in the red cap was keeping watch over two customers. The staff were then locked inside the office and some customers were told to wait in the breakroom area. The thieves then made off with 117 cellphones and an undisclosed amount of cash. Standing next to the suspect in the red cap, the man in the green shirt is another robber. On the 18th of October, Mall customers were traumatised after yet another armed robbery took place at the Touch Of Gold Jewellery Store.
