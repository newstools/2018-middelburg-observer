 Commonly known as Blaze, Puff or Herbal Blend, the dangerous concoction was responsible for the hospitalisation of 14 young people.
As stories of its effect aired on media platforms, it became evident that it was widely spread through the Gauteng Province. Its sudden appearance made people question the availability of the drug in most tobacco stores and cafes.
Turns out, the blend is supposed to be used as incense and has been on the shelves for quite some time. It is unknown as to how long people have been smoking it. The Middelburg Observer scoured local businesses in Middelburg and Mhluzi but the drug was hard to find. According to the medical specialists who treated the young victims, the Blaze users displayed symptoms similar to that of the drug Flakka.
The symptoms consist of dizziness, nausea, delirium, convulsions and extreme strength. Traces of the drug found in Pretoria was sold in gold, silver and black packaging.
