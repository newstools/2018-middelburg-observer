 Scammers walk past their targets smearing them with a black ink or powder on the arm. Another scammer, disguised as a security officer or police officer, approaches the target telling them that they saw what happened and that it was a witch doctor. The “officer” tells the victim that the witch doctor has access to their bank information or that the witch doctor is able to magically clean their bank account. The “officer” further convinces the target that they need to withdraw their money in their bank account as soon as possible and that they will escort them and keep them safe.
After the victim has withdrawn all the money out of their bank account, the “officer” escorts the victim to a “safe” place. According to Gunmar Security, this is where the scammers rob the victims of their money, either by using violence or giving them a drink with a sleeping aid.
