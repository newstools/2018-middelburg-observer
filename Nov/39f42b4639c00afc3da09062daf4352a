 “Nothing beats playing someone their favourite jam. The joy on someone’s face or that involuntary, awkward boogie that just can’t be helped when their song is playing, is what I want,” says Christiaan. Christiaan started out as a professional sound engineer and guitarist/co-writer for original bands “I Am The Army“ and “The Vacancy” and co-produced both their debut EP’s.To do music professionally isn’t for everyone, and “going solo” really just means “want to work”. So Christiaan started singing and getting together a repertoire of cover songs. As musical director he keeps the songs shaped and the musicians rehearsed to ensure a great live show. “That’s My Jam” can be as small as Christiaan alone with his acoustic guitar, to a full rock band bashing out hit after hit with top musicians. On Saturday he will be performing alone. •Christiaan is currently working on original music under the name “Senile” and soon his own songs will be hurled into the crazy music world. The music will be inviting to anyone looking for an alternative to the norm. For bookings, call Christiaan at 082 895 8435.
