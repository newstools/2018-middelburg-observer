 One of the persons who found himself in the middle of the protest, was transporting explosives. He said that he thought it was an accident involving a truck when approaching the scene and only realised what was really happening after it was too late. The man said that he was told to switch off his vehicle and warned that if he tried to drive any further, his vehicle would be set alight. Coal and stationary trucks make it impossible to drive on the N11 at this stage. He said that protesters did not realise that he was carrying explosives. After being trapped for some time, a police van rushed to his aid and managed to escort him to safety. The man said that the N11 at the Pullenshope offramp is blocked, as well as the entrance to Woestalleen mine. Photos from the scene taken shortly before 08:00 this morning. At 08:00 the road remains closed with stationary coal trucks and coal heaps blocking the way. The police’s public order policing unit has only just arrived on the scene. The red dot indicates where the protest action is according to a motorist who was trapped in the protest.
