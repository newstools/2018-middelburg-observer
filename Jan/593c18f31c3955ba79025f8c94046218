Motorists were flabbergasted by a police van stuck on its side inside the Olifants River a short distance from the bridge crossing on the N4 on Thursday. Presently its still unclear what transpired but eyewitnesses say that the marked police van had been in the river since Wednesday night. Van Wettens were awaiting instructions to hoist up the van from the river since 08:00 this morning. No police members were present on the scene to give explanations on how exactly the van ended up in the water. It is believed that the driver lost control of the van in slippery conditions before plunging into the river. eMalahleni SAPS spokespersons could not be reached for comment.
