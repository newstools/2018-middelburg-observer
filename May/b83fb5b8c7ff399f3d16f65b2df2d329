  A body was found under the Meyer Street Bridge next to the Klein Olifants River by a passer by on his way to OK Grocer. Police were called to the scene. The area was cordoned off to stem a flow of curious onlookers from reaching the scene. People gathered on the bridge above the scene to see if they can catch a glimpse of the body. One woman, driving a Toyota Avanza full of school kids, was so curious, that she stopped her vehicle on the bridge, partially blocking traffic, and got out to have a peek over the bridge’s side. In the process she left the children in the car, in the very real danger of being hit by an oncoming truck not able to stop fast enough. She was very offended and started curssing at bystanders when they asked her to get move her car from the bridge. Police are currently waiting for members of the Forensic department to arrive on the scene.
