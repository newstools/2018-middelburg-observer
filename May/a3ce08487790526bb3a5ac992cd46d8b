 Damian’s body was found drifting in the Middelburg Dam, two weeks after he was last seen. His family feared him dead after he disappeared without taking any of his personal belongings, like his wallet and cellphone. A day before Damian’s body was discovered by the Middelburg Dam caretaker, the police’s K9 Search and Rescue unit braved the cold weather to search for him. Sgt. Leon Harrington of the K9 Search and Rescue unit during the search for Damian. The body was spotted next to the dam wall when the dam caretaker went to take his daily reading. At this stage it is not clear how Damian’s life came to an end. He was found fully clothed with shoes on. Sgt. Leon Harrington and his dog Tara in the Klein Olifants River during the search operation. An autopsy was performed earlier this week. The results thereof have not been made public pending the police and a private investigation. The family has since acquired the services of well-known private investigator, Brad Nathanson.
