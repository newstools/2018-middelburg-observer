 A reward is offered for anyone with information about two bicycles stolen in front of OK Grocer in Jeppe Street on Monday afternoon. Video material show how two boys leave their bicycles in front of the grocery store entrance before entering the shop. Two young children follow closely behind. Once they have had a cautious look around to see if no one is watching, they each take a bicycle and disappear. Both bicycles are yellow and black in colour. The one is a Silverback and the other a Cube brand. Anyone with information can contact Debbie on 060 987 5150.
