 A concerned resident took a video of the children waiting next to the road. They have missed three weeks of school because the bus supposed to transport them there, has broken down. The children, some as young as six years old, live to far from their school to attempt and walk there.  The resident said that when the bus do take them to school, it often fails to take them back, forcing small children to walk up to 30 km to get back home. “Do you have any idea how worried you would have been if your six year-old child did not arrive home from school? Your child does not have a cellphone to call him on and you don’t have a car to go search for them? It is unthinkable to put a parent and a child trough that.” • The resident requested to stay anonymous.
