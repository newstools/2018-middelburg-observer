 MyBroadband has launched their mobile testing network project together with Afristay and Samsung. They have traveled along the N4 and tested the mobile network quality in in various towns, including Middelburg and neighbouring eMalahleni. Jan Vermeulen wrote that although MTN was the best network in Middelburg, Vodacom scored highest for the best overall network with good performances in both towns. The tests were conducted by using the My Broadband Speed Test App on a Samsung Galaxy S9 phone. A network quality score out of ten was given. Download speed, upload speed and latency (the delay before data transfer begins following the instruction for its transfer) were taken into account during the scoring process. In eMalahleni Cell C was the top performing network with 8,95 out of 10, Vodacom came second with 8,92, MTN third with 8,5 and Telkom last with a score of 6,43.
