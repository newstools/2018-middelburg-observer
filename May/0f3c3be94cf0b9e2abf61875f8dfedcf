 The poaching incident took place in the Loskop Nature Reserve recently. One of the reserve’s game rangers discovered the rhino cow’s carcass. She was killed with a large caliber rifle and her horn was sawed off.  Her calf was missing.  Game rangers attempted to search the 26 000 hectare reserve for the orphaned calf. A micro-light aircraft as well as a drone belonging to Deon Cornelius of Ubhetyan, was used in the search. The help of specialized trackers from Wildlife Investigations and Protection Services (WIPS) were called in.
