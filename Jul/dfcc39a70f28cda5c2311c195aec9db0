 Even though www.mobserver.co.za will be doing everything in our power to cover as many events as possible, we all know we can only be in one place at one time. So for that reason we ask the public to kindly send us photos of your good deeds so that we may share it on our website and in our newspaper.
Those who are interested may email their photos and information to sjani@mobserver.co.za.
Remember to include the name of your organisation, along with the details of who you will be giving your time or donations to. Now go and make a difference!
