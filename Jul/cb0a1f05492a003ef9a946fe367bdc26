 Councillor Van Zyl informed the Observer that Hendrina residents have been sitting with continuous cuts in the water supply since Sunday. The restrictions in the water supply are a result of maintenance problems at the water purification plant.

The demand for water exceeds the supply by 120%, which means that the water hardly reaches half of the town before it is used up.
