 The Foschini branch in O.R Tambo Street was robbed by five armed suspects earlier today. While the police are busy investigating the scene, it is still unclear what exactly was taken. A shop assistant at Markham, one of the neighbouring stores, said that they could hear screaming from next door, but never witnessed the suspects themselves. When they heard the commotion, they ran next door but the suspects had already fled the scene. The staff at Foschini politely declined to comment. •Reports were received that one of the men had a scar on his face and another wore a black bomber jacket and jeans. Media spokesperson Captain Khanyisile Zwane has informed www.mobserver.co.za that a BOLO has been sent out for a white Kia with the following registration number: FC78SPGP. The vehicle was last seen heading in the direction of the R555 (Old Witbank road). Anyone with any information may call the Middelburg Police Station on 013 249 1608/9. A police vehicle responded to the scene.  •In an unrelated incident, the HiFi Corporation branch at Fountain Square was also ambushed by eight armed men a couple of weeks ago.
