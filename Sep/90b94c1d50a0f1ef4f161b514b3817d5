 Mr Gerrie Gerrits, owner, confirmed that the lion cub on the video, was indeed one of the two cubs who were stolen at Pienaardam in the early hours of Thursday morning. At first it seemed that there was only one person who made a video of the man with the cub. A video, which was later circulated on Facebook, shows clearly that a lot of people took videos of the man with the lion cub. •A suspect was arrested over the weekend, but the cubs are still missing.
