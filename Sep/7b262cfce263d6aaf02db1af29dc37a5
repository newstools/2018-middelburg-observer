 Tshepo Mohlala’s trial has been placed on the Delmas court roll from 8-12 October. He is charged with murder, as well as defeating the administration of justice. It is alleged that Mohlala murdered Thebatso Serage in November last year. It was reported that Mohlala allegedly suffocated her with a pillow, hid her body under a bed and then later took her to a deserted place where she was set alight and cut into pieces to fit into a bag. Mohlala was allegedly caught in the act by passers-by who handed him over to the Mhluzi Police.
