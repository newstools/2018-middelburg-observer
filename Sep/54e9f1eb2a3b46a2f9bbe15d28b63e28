 Marisa Roets says that they are extremely worried about the safety of Phillip Mkhonza (64). The truck Mr Mkhonza was driving, was hijacked on Wednesday morning close to Mookgophong. The company managed to track the truck and recovered it in the field next to the N11 between Roedtan and Marble Hall. All of Mr Mkhonza’s personal belongings were still in the truck, but he was nowhere to be found. “I am asking my friends, and friends of friends, to please share this post. Social media has such a strong voice, just maybe somewhere someone sees this and can help us find him and return him safely to his family,” Ms Roets said in an emotional appeal on Facebook. Mr Mkhonza is described as a man of medium height with a bald head. He was last seen wearing blue overalls. Anyone with information can contact Mrs Roets on 072 600 1269.
