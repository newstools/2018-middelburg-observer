 The man who they tried to arrest for assault with intent, is however still roaming free while the man he allegedly assaulted has fled Machadodorp after receiving death threats. Highveld Emporium has been completely destroyed and its owner, whose house was also pelted with rocks, also has to seek safety outside Machadodorp.
His shop was looted by community members before being set alight today. The racial unrest boiled over due to a feud between the Highveld Emporium’s owner and a central figure in Monday’s assault in Potgieter Street, after a property deal between them went sour.
