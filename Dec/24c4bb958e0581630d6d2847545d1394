 “God the Father calls us now to bring this senseless carnage on our roads to an end,” said Jan de Bruin (Executive Director, Highway Ministries). According to Mr De Bruin, Highway Prayer Patrol has aimed to combat road deaths by prayer and direct engagement with Arrive Alive and other road safety actions since 2006. “We received a command from the Lord to organise a National Day of Prayer against road deaths.” Prayer teams will go to high-risk areas where accidents occur frequently, praying against accidents and fatalities at these sites.
These areas can be identified in conjunction with police and traffic divisions in your town and surrounding area. He appeals to all Christian churches and institutions to devote messages and prayers to the causes and reasons for this enormous mortality rate on our roads. They ask leaders of all Christian denominations to focus this day on road safety from a biblical perspective. Churches and organisations can colour the day by inviting traffic and police officers to talk about what they experience and learn about road users behaviour, attitude and obedience to the law. The theme of prayer is: “Road Safety Begins with Me”. The prayer initiative is from today (14 December) to 10 January and the prayer tents will be pitched at the following places: •N4 Alzu Petroport between Middelburg and Belfast, Mpumalanga. •N4 Kaap Muiden at the Malelane Toll Plaza, Mpumalanga. •N3 Total Petroport from north to south, between Alberton and Heidelberg. •N1 Bergsig Motors Worcester, Western Cape.
