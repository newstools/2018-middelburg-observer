 Residents made the gruesome discovery on the 24th of October in Ext. 8, Mhluzi. The body was found wrapped in a blanket with a garbage bag over her head on the sidewalk outside a private residence.
She had burn marks that resembled the element of a hot plate on her face and abdomen, as well as multiple stab wounds. Hours after the discovery, the state patholigists found a woman’s breast in a dustbin near the scene. A foreign national named Amanuel Heramo was arrested for murder after the Mhluzi SAPS found blood stains and hair near his bedroom.
The woman’s body had been dumped 100 metres from his spaza shop. He has since appeared in court four times but has not been sentenced yet. The police are waiting for the post-mortem results that will determine the cause of death. They are asking anyone with information on the victim’s identity or her next of kin to contact Constable John Phoku at 072 216 7505. •For more information on the story, buy Friday’s issue of the Middelburg Observer.
