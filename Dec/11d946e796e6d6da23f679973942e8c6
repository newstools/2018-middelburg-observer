 The head-on collision occurred shortly before 21:00 on Tuesday night, when a truck and a taxi travelling in opposite directions on the R575 (Van Dyksdrift Road), collided. A www.mobserver.co.za journalist who was on the scene said that the taxi was split in two with bodies strewn everywhere.  The magnitude of the accident required all of the available local emergency services to be on scene. Initial reports from the scene were that 14 people died. The Mpumalanga Department of Community Safety and Security said on Wednesday that the official number of people that passed away is 11, of which seven are women, two are men, and two children (one boy, one girl).   On Wednesday morning the scene was still not cleared causing huge traffic delays on the Van Dyksdrift road, with forensics and police still on scene. The accident scene was the cause of several other fender benders, as well as a more serious accident in which one person had to be transported to hospital by ambulance.
