 13:00 Murder accused Amanuel Heramo was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly murdering a woman and dumping her mutilated body outside a private residence. The bail application was postponed to October 26, due to a language barrier. The suspect requested for an Aramaic interpreter. ANC and EFF supporters filled the public gallery in court. On October 17, members of the public discovered a 25-year-old woman’s mutilated corpse in Extension 8. The woman was found naked with a black plastic bag around her head and a blanket covering her body. The time of her murder is estimated to be at least three days before the horrific discovery.
