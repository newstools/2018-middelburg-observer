 Even before the sitting commenced, singing and dancing infront of the gallery indicated that councillors would be in for a rough ride. People waving placards reading “Thanks for new leadership Mr Tolo” and “More corruption” among other slogans, were also raised.  The issue of land exproriation without compensation had the public divided when the DA’s Palesa Mobango accused the ANC government of sitting on land, but not giving it to the needy. Her accusation came in response to Mayoral Committee Member Ms Sonto Malepeng’s call for “whites to give the land back”. Ms Mobango grilled the ANC, to loud applause of the gallery, on the party’s first come first served policy in regards to available stands in Middelburg. “A man or woman earning R5000 a month cannot be expected to pay R35 000 for a stand in a single month, and now stands have been taken away from those who mostly need them,” she said.
