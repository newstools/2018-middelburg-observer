 Unions are calling on workers across the country to stay away from work on Wednesday to join the nationwide strike against the proposed national minimum wage of R20 per hour. Phakamile Hlubi-Majola of the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) says  members will be on strike tomorrow but they will not be marching in Mpumalanga. The Chief Executive Officer of Middelburg Chamber of Commerce & Industry, Anna-Mart Ott says business will run as usual at the Chamber of Commerce, “we will be operating as normal tomorrow and we will apply the no-work-no-pay policy to those who will not report to work,” said Ms Ott. Steelcrest High School and the Ekwazi Secondary School say from what they know everything will be operating as normal, learners and staff members are expected to report to school tomorrow. Trade Unions are expected to take to the streets in Johannesburg, Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Bloemfontein and Polokwane to protest against the proposed national minimum wage.
