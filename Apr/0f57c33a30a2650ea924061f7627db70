 Mr Thomo had been stabbed so viciously that his ears were only connected to his body by thin pieces of flesh. When the multiple stab wounds inflicted didn’t kill him, his murderers drove over his body in the middle of the road and sped off. His body was found by passersby on the route leading to the back of Mhluzi’s Avalon district. Mr Thomo was 25 years old and moved to Middelburg two months ago where he worked as security guard at the municipal magazine. He was living with an uncle for his short while in town. He is originally from Badplaas where his family plans to lay him to rest.  Add us on WhatsApp for regular news updates.
