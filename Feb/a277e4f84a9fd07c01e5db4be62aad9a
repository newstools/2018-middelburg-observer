The student warned fishermen and bush dwellers not to go too close to the waterâ€™s edge. She was adamant that what she saw was not a water monitor, but a crocodile swimming in the water as she crossed the Meyer Street bridge. Several residents have claimed crocodile sightings. In October 2012, someone managed to take a video of something swimming in the water under the same bridge.  The Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency has refuted claims after visiting the area to look for signs that a crocodile might be living in the river.
