 It was just learned that the petition has been successful, meaning that the case will be brought before the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein. A date has not been set. It is claimed that the state did not oppose the petition before the cutoff date. Judge Sheila Mphahlele refused the duo leave to appeal after she found them guilty of attempted murder, kidnapping, assault with the intent to cause grievous bodily harm and intimidation for pushing Victor Mlotshwa into a coffin. Oosthuyzen was sentenced to an effective 11 years and Jackson to 14 years in jail in October last year.  In January, Oosthuyzen and Jackson’s legal representative, Marius Coertze, brought an application for leave to appeal the refusal of bail, before Judge Mphahlele in the Middelburg High Court. Mr Coertze argued that a recent court finding in Gauteng, found that bail should be considered when there is no danger to the administration of justice and little chance of absconding. The application was denied. It is understood that a petition for leave to appeal the ruling has also been filed with the Supreme Court of Appeal. The outcome thereof is still unknown.
