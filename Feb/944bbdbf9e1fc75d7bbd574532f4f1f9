 Gupta owned Optimum Mine has not paid its Pullenshope water purification plant workers, resulting in a total water shutdown in Hendrina the past four days. Steve Tshwete Municipality’s Mayor Mike Masina told www.mobserver.co.za that crisis meeetings will be held today to address the situation. He says that he’s been desperately trying to contact Optimum Mine COO Mr George van der Merwe but that his calls and messages remain unanswered. Jo-Jo tanks have been carted into Hendrina and Kwazamakuhle though Hendrina’s main reservoir is empty due to the shutdown. The town has been left without water following problems at the Optimum water plant. The town has experienced a number of shutdowns since December. Meanwhile a R100 000 reward has been offered for the successful arrest of Ajay Gupta following raids on the Gupta’s Saxonworld compound on Wednesday. Optimum is owned jointly by the Guptas and former Presidents Jacob Zuma’s son Duduzane who also faces arrest in relation to the Freestate dairy farm scandal. Middelburg businesses have also confirmed that they haven’t received any payment for services from both Optimum and Koornfontein Mines, which is also owned by the Guptas. Water trucks will have multiple daily runs into Hendrina and Kwazamakuhle until the matter is resolved. Power Construction and Sanral committed to supplying water to Hendrina’s old age home with more than 80 residents, from Bethal.
