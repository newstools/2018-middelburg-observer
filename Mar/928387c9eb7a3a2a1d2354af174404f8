 Even residents of Mhluzi assisted with the massive cleaning operation. Teams descended on the dam at 07:00 to rid it of the water grass that had taken over, choking the life out of the dam. Yolande Stapelberg and Eddie Louw started the Save our Dennesig Duck Dam Facebook group, and a call was made on residents to assist.  The day was a huge success with more than half of the dam being cleared. It is an ongoing process and the entire dam could not be cleared.  Add us on WhatsApp for regular news updates.
