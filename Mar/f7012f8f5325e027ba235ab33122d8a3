 The cats, three males and one female, arrived on the game farm at around 01:00 Saturday morning, after a trip from Wild Cats World outside PE to Middelburg, over 28 hours. One of the males, Solo, weighed in at a whopping 63 kg.  The other males Beau and Bahati, and single female Olive, all weighed in between 40 and 45 kg. Wild Cats World decided to move the animals to uBhetyan with the help of Wild Heart Wildlife Foundation for release back into the wild. A team from the University of Pretoria’s Faculty of Veterinary Science monitored the cats alongside Dr Nolan Landman from eMalahleni during the trip. The cats all fed after growing accustomed to their new environment where they share the reserve with white and brown lions, hyenas and other wild animals. • Video courtesy of Antare Productions and Mr Frank Schoombee  Add us on WhatsApp for regular news updates.
