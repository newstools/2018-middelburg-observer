 Mr Mnguni was replaced by new Acting Municipal Manager Mr Bheki Khenisa, an attorney by trade. Mr Khenisa’s appointment by recommendation of the province has resulted in legal action to remove him, being taken on by the Concerned Middelburg Residents Association. Mr Mnguni’s exit was followed by Mayor Mike Masina being recalled and deployed to the Nkangala District Municipality. Mr Mnguni replaced former Municipal Manager Mr Willie Fouché after Mr Fouché groomed him for the position for two years. The municipality advertised the vacancy but the process fell flat spurring the ANC majority in council to refer them to the province for a recommendation. The team, comprising Mayor Masina as political head, in partnership with both Mr Fouché and Mr Mnguni, made a formidable powerhouse with annual clean audits and the town becoming the fastest economic growth hub in the province. This massive loss is aggravated by the loss of Mr Carel Roos of the municipality’s building inspectorate and Rudolph Bouwer who was the Deputy Director of the Civil Engineering Department. Mr Bouwer retired after 43 years of service in Middelburg while Mr Roos worked in the municipality for 45 years. The electrical department also lost Mr Johan van Rooyen while both Johan Naudé and Willie Hurn left the municipality’s financial department. Mr Mnguni asked that the paper not disclose his current position or name the company where he has found employment in Johannesburg. He said he resigned before his contract expired and that his focus has now shifted from public representative in the municipal administration to that of a family man.
